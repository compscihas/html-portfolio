<h1>The Best Movies According to Hasan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>Interstellar is an incredible movie because it brings together mind-blowing visuals and a story that really tugs at your heart.
  It's not just another sci-fi film; it dives into real science concepts like black holes and time travel, which makes it even more
  fascinating. The music by Hans Zimmer is unforgettable and adds so much emotion to every scene. Matthew McConaughey's performance
  is so relatable, balancing all the big space stuff with real human feelings. In the end, it makes you think about big questions 
  like love, survival, and what it means to be human.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Shutter Island is an intense psychological thriller that keeps you guessing right until the end. The way it mixes mystery,
  suspense, and drama makes it impossible to look away. Leonardo DiCaprio’s performance is raw and emotional, pulling you into
  the mind of his troubled character. The eerie atmosphere and stunning cinematography create a sense of unease that builds 
  throughout the film. By the time it's over, you're left questioning reality and the line between sanity and madness, which
  is what makes it such a powerful movie.

<h3>Scarface</h3>
<p>Tony Montana, the ultimate rise-and-fall story, is larger than life in Scarface and an absolute blast to watch. He starts
  from nothing, hustling his way to the top with a "say hello to my little friend" attitude that’s both terrifying and
  hilarious. Al Pacino nails the role, making Tony a character you weirdly root for, even though he’s totally unhinged. The
  movie is full of over-the-top moments, wild quotes, and enough swagger to fill an entire Cuban cigar factory.</p>
